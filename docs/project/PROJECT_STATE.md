# Current Status

CellAO NightPredator is a local C#/.NET Framework-era Anarchy Online server workspace. Current work is focused on making the server compatible with Mike's current AO client and local `cellao_codex_clean` MySQL database through evidence-backed packet, gameplay, and data repairs.

# Working Systems

- Login, chat, and zone engines build and run locally.
- Current-client `FullCharacter` version 26 and live-style login state are locked project decisions.
- Sit/stand behavior is repaired.
- Weapon and armor equipment visuals are repaired for the current test scope.
- Equipped items persist across relog in the documented test scope.
- Death/respawn white-screen behavior is repaired.
- Corpse use, item loot, credit loot, XP text, and corpse despawn have working documented paths. The completed corpse credit investigation fixed the `CorpseFullUpdate` cash offset, removed duplicate manual corpse credit chat, retained focused assertions, and passed Cliff Malle playtest verification.
- Player trade item and credit transfer have been repaired and verified in the documented test scope. Credit-only, item-only, mixed item-plus-credit, and cancel/decline trades behaved as expected, and no player trade display or commit defect was reproduced. Temporary `TRADE_*` logging remains available for future trade investigation.
- Vendor shop buy, sell, close, and current-client ICC shop stock coverage have been repaired for the captured Fair Trade areas.
- Surgery clinic and implant flows have documented repaired behavior.

# Partially Working Systems

- Inventory and container behavior work for several repaired flows but still need broader regression coverage.
- Combat works for basic weapon/NPC test scenarios, but packet semantics are not complete.
- Corpse visuals and `CorpseFullUpdate` remain areas for broader cleanup, but the corpse cash value offset is repaired and guarded by focused assertions.
- Shop/vendor database coverage is improved but still has remaining static vendor coverage gaps.
- Playfield/interior mapping has repaired fixtures and remaining audit candidates.
- Enemy spawn testing has supported low-level families, but final spawn tables are not complete.
- DB-backed mob loot is modeled and partially wired, with limited reviewed data.
- Nanos, tradeskills, teams, organizations, pets, missions, quests, perks, research, bank, bags, stacks, and containers need separate focused work.

# Known Broken Systems

- NPC chase/movement is high risk and not gameplay-ready.
- `PlayfieldAnarchyF` is documented as a current-client structure mismatch.
- Some packet classes are missing, under-modeled, or awaiting capture-backed runtime use.
- Broad static vendor coverage remains incomplete.
- Full gameplay systems for missions, quests, perks, research, pets, PvP/towers, teams, and organizations are not complete.

# Current Development Focus

The latest completed gameplay work verified player-to-player trade display and commit behavior after the corpse credit investigation. Future behavior changes should continue to use live capture, private-server capture, AO stripdown source, or local code facts as evidence.

# Last Completed Milestone

Player-to-player trade verification passed after temporary `TRADE_*` trace logging was added in commit `4b68d4e`. Verification showed:

- Credit-only trade behaved as expected.
- Item-only trade behaved as expected.
- Mixed item-plus-credit trade behaved as expected.
- Cancel/decline trade behaved as expected.
- No player trade display or commit defect was reproduced.
- Temporary `TRADE_*` logging remains available for future trade investigation.

Prior corpse credit repairs were pushed to `origin/master` in commits `343a31d` and `e953c76` after verification showed:

- `CorpseFullUpdate` cash stat id remains at offset `203`.
- Corpse cash value is patched at offset `207`.
- The old hardcoded `111` cash value is not preserved.
- Delayed corpse credit award mutates cash once and sends the normal changed-stat packet.
- Manual server `ChatText` corpse credit feedback is suppressed so the client displays one corrected message.
- Cliff Malle playtest displayed one `You received 3 credits from the corpse.` message.

Prior ICC/Fair Trade vendor stock repairs were pushed to `origin/master` in commit `cffc5da` after verification showed:

- vendor DB issues: 0
- shop inventory item-cache issues: 0
- tradeskill room captured rows: 3,101
- tradeskill vendor rows: 38

# Next Milestone

Build broader inventory/container regression coverage for repaired flows from `docs/ai/CURRENT_TASK.md`, keeping NPC movement out of scope unless explicitly selected later. Validate with focused source assertions and Mike's playtest when client behavior matters.
